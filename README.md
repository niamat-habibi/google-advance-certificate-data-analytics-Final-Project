📌 Key Findings

Salary & Job Satisfaction: Employees with lower salaries and job satisfaction levels show a higher attrition risk.

Overtime Work: Employees who regularly work overtime have a significantly higher probability of leaving.

Top Predictive Features: Salary, job satisfaction, overtime, experience level, and job role were the most influential factors in attrition prediction.
