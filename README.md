# Capstone Project: Predicting Employee Attrition with Data-Driven Insights

## üìå Project Overview
Employee attrition is a critical challenge for HR professionals, impacting workforce stability and business performance. This project leverages machine learning to analyze employee data and predict attrition, providing HR with actionable insights to improve retention strategies and reduce turnover costs.

## üéØ Project Goals
- Identify key factors influencing employee attrition.
- Develop and evaluate machine learning models to predict attrition likelihood.
- Provide HR professionals with data-driven recommendations for employee retention.

## üìä Dataset Information
- **Dataset Name:** HR_capstone_dataset.csv  
- **Download Link:** [HR_capstone_dataset.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K90C6cY6ELLkchGgAZP1Geg7WAtKHEta/view?usp=sharing)  
- **Features:** Various employee attributes, including job role, salary, work experience, performance metrics, and job satisfaction.  
- **Target Variable:** Employee Attrition (Yes/No)

## üöÄ Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and feature encoding.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** 
   - Identify key trends, such as the relationship between salary, job satisfaction, and attrition.
3. **Model Selection & Training:** 
   - Implement and compare Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost models.
4. **Model Evaluation:** 
   - Assess performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC Curve.
5. **Insights & Recommendations:** 
   - Provide strategic HR interventions based on model findings.

## üìà Model Performance
| Model                 | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-score |
|----------------------|----------|----------|--------|----------|
| Logistic Regression  | 78.5%    | 72.3%    | 65.8%  | 68.9%    |
| Decision Tree       | 82.1%    | 75.6%    | 71.2%  | 73.3%    |
| Random Forest       | 85.7%    | 79.3%    | 76.8%  | 78.0%    |
| XGBoost            | 87.2%    | 81.1%    | 78.9%  | 80.0%    |

### üìå Key Findings
- **Salary & Job Satisfaction:** Employees with lower salaries and job satisfaction levels show a higher attrition risk.
- **Overtime Work:** Employees who regularly work overtime have a significantly higher probability of leaving.
- **Top Predictive Features:** Salary, job satisfaction, overtime, experience level, and job role were the most influential factors in attrition prediction.
